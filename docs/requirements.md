## Problem Statement

IT service desks handle a large number of support tickets every day.  
However, it is often difficult for managers to understand how well the service desk is performing because the data is messy, spread across many fields, and not reported in a consistent way.

Without clear reporting, it is hard to answer basic questions such as:

- Are we meeting our SLA commitments?
- How large is the current backlog?
- Which types of tickets cause delays?

## Business Objective

The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end analytics solution that converts raw IT service desk ticket data into clear, reliable KPIs and dashboards.

The solution should help stakeholders:

- Monitor SLA performance
- Track backlog size and aging
- Understand response and resolution times
- Identify ticket drivers such as category, priority, and queue

## In Scope

- Analysis of IT service desk tickets
- KPI calculation for SLA, backlog, and timeliness
- Analysis by priority, queue, and category
- Data cleaning, transformation, and validation
- Reproducible analytics pipeline and dashboard

## Out of Scope

- Real-time data streaming
- Direct integration with live ServiceNow or Jira systems
- Performance evaluation of individual employees
